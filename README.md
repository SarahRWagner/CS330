## Designing Software and Developing Programs

When I start a project, I like to start by figuring out what the user really needs and then breaking those needs into smaller, manageable features. Working on this project helped me get better at modular design and trying out ideas during each week. I started with basic sketches and outlines for the 3D scene, then moved on building the scene object by object. This approach worked really well and gave me ideas for how I could handle bigger projects in the future, especially ones with a lot of moving parts. Testing as I went was super important—it let me tweak things and make improvements along the way instead of waiting until the end to fix everything.

When it came to actually building the program, I leaned into trying new strategies, like creating lighting and adding textures to all the objects. Iteration was a huge part of my process. Every step of the way, I tested what I’d built, made adjustments, and slowly improved the overall design. Over the course of the project, I found myself adding a new item and applying the topic of that week on the final project scene.

## Reaching My Goals Through Computer Science
Learning about openGL has given me a whole new perspective on how to present ideas visually. Plus, working on things like 3D scenes has boosted my creativity and problem-solving skills, which are super valuable no matter what field I’m working in. It’s been a great step forward toward both my short-term and long-term goals!
